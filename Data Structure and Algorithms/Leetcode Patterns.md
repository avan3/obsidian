Linear:
- Two pointers:
	- Can go in same direction:
		- Processing or scanning the data in a single pass
		- E.g. Fast-slow pointer approach to find a cycle or the middle of the list
	- Or opposite direction:
		- Used for finding pairs of comparing elements from opposite ends of the data structure
		- E.g. Find two numbers in a sorted array that sum up to a target value (i.e. Two Sum II)
- Sliding Window:
	- Maintaining a window of elements within the data dynamically adjusting the size as you progress through the data structure
	- Uses two pointers, but goal is to manage a subset of elements that satisfy a specific condition
		- One pointer marks the start of the window, the other pointer marks the end
	- E.g.  longest substring without repeating characters
- Binary Search:
	- Allows you to find a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the array in half
	- Uses two pointers
	- Useful for monotonic function - any type of pattern where there is a consistent increase or decrease 
	- Also useful for finding the first true occurrence (i.e. if the array had only true and false)
		- E.g. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
			- Any element lower than the last element in the array is part of the rotated section
			- Any element greater than the last element in the array is part of the original sorted section
Non-Linear:
- Data Structures:
	- Trees 
		- Trees are graphs with no cycles
	- Graphs
		- Have cycles
		- Need a visited set to keep track of nodes you've already visited
- Breadth-First Search
	- Use to explore nodes in a graph or tree level-by-level
		- Starts at a node (root) then moves to immediate neighbours before moving onto their neighbours
	- Uses a queue:
		- First in, First out (FIFO)
