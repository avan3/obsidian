- **What is RxJS**
	- Library for reactive programming - composing asynchronous and callback-based code in a functional, reactive style using observables
- **What is NgRX**
	- Framework for building reactive applications in Angular
	- Provides state management
	- Benefits:
		- Centralized, immutable state
			- All relevant application state exists in one location
			- Easier to track down problems, as a snapshot of the state at the time of the error can provide important insight and make it easy to recreate issues
		- Performance
			- Data updates can flow down through your components relying on slices of store
		- Testability
			- All state updates are handled in reducers, which are pure functions
- **What are observables**
	- Object similar to Promise that helps manage async code
	- Are declarative which provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in your application
	- Used for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values
	- In this case, you define a function for publishing values, but it is not executed until a consumer subscribes to it. The subscribed consumer then receives notifications until the function completes, or until they unsubscribe.
	- "Producer" of data
	- Has `.subscribe` method
- **What is an observer**
	- Is an interface for a consumer of push-based notifications delivered by an observable
	- ![[Pasted image 20250407133506.png]]
	- "Consumer" of data
	- Has `.next` method
- **What is subscribing**
	- An observable instance begins publishing values only when someone subscribes to it
	- Receiving notifications from the observable
	- Subscription is the execution of an observable
- **Operators**
	- Are pure functions that enable functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat, reduce, etc.
- **Push vs Pull**
	- Push: producer determines when to send data to the consumer
	- Pull: consumer determines when it receives data from the data producer
- **Difference between Promise and Observable**
	- Promise:
		- Build-in JavaScript object representing a value that will be available in the future
			- Handles one-time asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from a server or reading a file, and resolves with a single value or an error
		- Executes immediately upon creation
		- Provides only one value
		- Pushes errors to the child promises
		- Uses only `.then()` clause
	- Observable:
		- Part of the RxJS library and is used extensively in Angular. It represents a stream of values that can emit multiple items over time
		- Declarative: Computation does not start until subscription, so they can run whenever you need the result
		- Provides multiple values over time
		- Subscribe method is used for error handling
		- Provides chaining and subscription to handle complex applications
- **What is multicasting**
	- The practice of broadcasting to a list of multiple subscribers in a single execution
- **How do you perform error handling in observables**
	- Can specify a second callback (*error callback*) on the observer instead of relying on `try/catch` which is ineffective in asynchronous environment
- **What is the shorthand notation for subscribe method?**
	- Accepts three callback function definitions for `next`, `error`, and `complete` handlers
- **Utility functions provided by RxJS**
	- Converting existing code for async operations into observables
	- Iterating through the values in a stream
	- Mapping values to different types
	- Filtering streams
	- Composing multiple streams
- **What happens if you do not supply handler for the observer**
	- If you do not supply a handler for a notification type, the observer just ignores notifications of that type
- **What are reducers in NgRX**
	- Reducers are pure functions that are responsible for handling transitions from one state to the next state in your application
	- Reducers handle these transitions by determining which actions to handle based on the actions type
	- Reducers *change* state by making a copy of existing state and changing one or more properties on the new state
		- Since the state in NgRX is immutable
- **What are actions in NgRX**
	- One of the main building blocks in NgRX
	-  Express unique events that happen throughout your applications
	- Objects that extend the NgRX Action class with a `type` property
	- Have an optional `payload` property for sending data to the effect/reducer and are dispatched by the store to either run an effect or change state in a reducer
- **What are states in NgRX**
	- A single, immutable data structure
	- Actions describe state changes
	- Pure functions, called reducers, take the previous state and the next action to compute the new state
	- State accessed with the Store, an observable of state and observer of actions
