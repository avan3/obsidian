- **What is RxJS**
	- Library for reactive programming - composing asynchronous and callback-based code in a functional, reactive style using observables
	- 
- **What are observables**
	- Object similar to Promise that helps manage async code
	- Are declarative which provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in your application
	- Used for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values
	- In this case, you define a function for publishing values, but it is not executed until a consumer subscribes to it. The subscribed consumer then receives notifications until the function completes, or until they unsubscribe.
- **What is an observer**
	- Is an interface for a consumer of push-based notifications delivered by an observable

- **What is subscribing**
	- An observable instance begins publishing values only when someone subscribes to it
	- Receiving notifications from the observable
- **Difference between Promise and Observable**
	- Promise:
		- Executes immediately upon creation
		- Provides only one value
		- Pushes errors to the child promises
		- Uses only `.then()` clause
	- Observable:
		- Declarative: Computation does not start until subscription, so they can run whenever you need the result
		- Provides multiple values over time
		- Subscribe method is used for error handling
		- Provides chaining and subscription to handle complex applications
- **What is multicasting**
	- The practice of broadcasting to a list of multiple subscribers in a single execution
- **How do you perform error handling in observables**
	- Can specify a second callback (*error callback*) on the observer instead of relying on `try/catch` which is ineffective in asynchronous environment
- **What is the shorthand notation for subscribe method?**
	- Accepts three callback function definitions for `next`, `error`, and `complete` handlers
- **Utility functions provided by RxJS**
	- Converting existing code for async operations into observables
	- Iterating through the values in a stream
	- Mapping values to different types
	- Filtering streams
	- Composing multiple streams
- **What happens if you do not supply handler for the observer**
	- If yo do not supply a handler for a notification type, the observer just ignores notifications of that type
