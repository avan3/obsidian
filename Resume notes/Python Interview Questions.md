- **Python interpreted or compiled**
	- It is both
	- First it is compiled into source code (bytecode `.pyc`), then it is interpreted by the official CPython or JIT compiled by PyPy
- **PYTHONPATH**
	- Environment variable which you can set to add additional directories where Python will look for modules and packages
- **What is an iterator in Python**
	- An object that can be iterated upon, meaning you can traverse through all the values
	- An object which implements the iterator protocol, which consists of the methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()` 
		- `__iter__()` method initializes an iterator
		- `__next__()` returns the next item in the iteration and points to the next element
- **What is the `__init__()` function in Python?**
	- All classes in Python have a function called `__init__()` which is always executed when the class is being initiated
	- Equivalent to constructors in OOP terminology
	- Reserved method in Python classes
	- Use when assigning values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created
- **When should you use lambda functions in Python?**
	- When an anonymous function is required for a short period of time
	- Can accept any number of arguments, but can only have a single expression
	- E.g. `mul = lambda a, b : a * b`
- **Difference between lists, tuples, and sets**
	- All used to store multiple items in a single variable
	- List:
		- Collection of data which is ordered and changeable (elements can be added, removed and changed)
	- Tuple:
		- Collection of data which is ordered and unchangeable (elements cannot be added, removed, or changed)
	- Set:
		- Collection of data which is unordered, unchangeable (elements can be added and removed, but not changed), and unindexed
- **How can you check if all the characters in a string are alphanumeric?**
	- Use `isalnum()` method to check if all characters if alphanumeric (alphabet letters `a-z` and numbers `0-9`)
- **Correct syntax to output the type of a variable or object in Python**
	- `print(type(x))`
- **Split vs Join**
	- `split()` function to split a string based on a delimiter to a list of strings
		- E.g. `string_list = string.split(' ')`
	- `join()` to join a list of strings based on a delimiter to output a single string
		- E.g. `' '.join(string_list)`
- **Python build-in data types**
	- Text Type: `str`
	- Numeric Types: `int`, `float`, `complex`
	- Sequence Types: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
		- Have the `in` and `not in` operators defined for their traversing their elements
	- Mapping Type: `dict`
	- Set Types: `set`, `frozenset`
	- Boolean Type: `bool`
	- Binary Types: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`
	- None type: `None`
		- Represents null values in Python
- **Python membership operators**
	- Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is present in an object
	- The `in` and `not in` operators are examples of these:
		- `print("banana" in x)`
		- `print("pineapple" not in x)`
- **Statement that can be used to avoid errors if an `if` statement has no content**
	- `pass`
	- Can also be used in a function with no content
	- Filling up empty blocks of code which may execute during runtime but has yet to be written
	- Can skip errors during code execution
- **Arbitrary Arguments**
	- Shortened to `*args`
	- If you do not know how many arguments will be passed into your function, add a `*` before the parameter name in the function definition
		- Function will receive a tuple of arguments and can access the items accordingly
- **Can you copy a List in Python by simply writing: `list2 = list1`**
	- No, because `list2` will only be a reference to `list1` and changes made in `list1` will automatically also be made in `list2`
	- To make a copy of a list, you can use `copy()` or the `list()` method
- **How can you return a range of characters of a string**
	- Using the "slice syntax"
	- Specify the start index and end index, separated by a colon, to return part of a string
	- `substring = s[start : end : step]`
	- E.g. `print(b[2:5])`
- **Python is a dynamically typed language**
	- Static typed: data type is known at compile time 
		- E.g. Java
	- Dynamically typed: do not require any pre-defined data type for any variable
		- E.g. Python, JavaScript
- **Variable Scope in Python**
	- Scope is a block of code where an object in Python remains relevant
	- Local, Global, Module, Outermost (built-in names)
	- E.g. declaring a variable of global-scope does not interfere with setting a variable of local-scope within a function
	- ![[Pasted image 20250423220634.png]]
- **Difference between / and // in Python**
	- / represents precise division and results in a floating point number
	- // represents floor division and results in an integer
	- E.g. 
		- `5//2 = 2, 5/2 = 2.5`
- **Is Python Pass by Value or Pass by Reference**
	- Neither. It is "Pass by Object Reference"
	- Depending on the type of object you pass in the function, the function behaves differently
		- Immutable objects show "pass by value", wheras;
		- Mutable objects show "pass by reference"
			- For lists, you can append to the list
			- But reassigning the list will not persist
-  **How is dictionary different from a list**                   ]
	- List is ordered collection of items accessed by index
	- Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs accessed using unique keys
	- E.g. `[10,20,30]` vs `{"a": 10, "b": 20, "c": 30}`
- **What is list comprehension**
	- A way to create lists using concise syntax
	- Generate new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable
	- E.g. `[val ** 2 for val in a]`
- **What is dictionary comprehension**
	- Syntax construction to ease the creation of a dictionary based on an existing iterable
	- E.g. `{ k:v for (k,v) in zip(keys, values) }`
- **Tuple comprehension in Python**
	- Not possible
- `*args` **vs** `**kwargs`
	- `*args` passes in arguments as a list
	- `**kwargs` passes in arguments as a dictionary
- **How can you concatenate two lists in Python**
	- Using the + operator
		- E.g. `list1 + list2`
	- Using the `extend()` method
		- E.g. `list1.extend(list2)`
- **Exception handling in Python**
	- `try`, `except`, `finally`
- **Array vs List**
	- In python, arrays are a collection of numeric elements that are all of the same type
		- Requires importing a module
	- Lists are more flexible than arrays and can hold elements of different types
		- Built-in, does not require importing additional modules
- **Difference between modules and packages**
	- Module is a single file that contains Python code which can be reused in other programs
		- Think of it as a code library
		- Benefits:
			- Simplicity
				- Helps you focus on a relatively small portion of the problem at hand
			- Maintainability
				- Designed to enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains
				- Reduces interdependency, less likely that modifications in a module might impact other parts of the program
			- Reusability
				- Can be easily reused by other parts of the application
			- Scoping
				- Typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid confusion between identifiers in other parts of the program
	- Package is a collection of related modules stored in a directory (file structure)
		- Importing a module or its contents from this package requires the package name as prefix to the module named joined by a dot
- **Range function in Python**
	- Functions that could be used to iterate a certain number of times in for loops in Python
	- `range()` returns a range object, which is an immutable sequence type that generates the numbers on demand
- **Shallow vs Deep copy**
	- Assignment operator (i.e. `=`) does not copy objects, but creates binding between the existing object and target variable name (acts like it copies though)
	- Shallow copy: 
		- Copies only the reference of the object
		- Any changes made to the new copy is changed in the original object
		- Is faster
		- Can use copy function (i.e. `=` or `copy()`)
	- Deep copy:
		- Copies the objects values and creates new object
		- Changes to new copy is not changed in the original object
		- Is comparatively slower
		- Use deep copy function (i.e. `deepcopy()`)
- **Difference between `==` and `is` operator in Python**
	- Both used for comparison but serve different purposes
	- `==`:
		- Checks for equality of the values which means it evaluates whether the values of two objects are the same
	- `is`:
		- Checks for identity, meaning it determines whether two variables point to the same object in memory
	- E.g.
		- `x = [1,2,3], y = [1,2,3]`
		- `x == y` is true
		- `x is y` is false
- **`sorted()` vs `sort()` in Python**
	- `sorted()`
		- Sorts the given sequence as well as set and dictionary either in ascending or descending order and always returns a sorted list
		- Method does not affect the original sequence
	- `sort()`
		- Unlike `sorted()`, this method returns nothing and makes changes to the original sequence
		- Also is a method of list class and can only be used with lists
- **Generators in Python**
	- Generator is a function that returns an iterable collection of items, one at a time, in a set manner
	- The `yield` keyword pauses the current execution by saving its states and then resumes from the same when required
- **Python supports multiple inheritence**
	- Multiple inheritance is when a class is derived from more than one base class
	- The derived class inherits all features from the base class
- **Polymorphism**
	- The ability to take multiple forms
	- Allows different classes to be treated as if they are instances of the same class through a common interface
- **Inheritance**
	- Creating a child class from a parent class
		- E.g. 
			- `class Person:` --> Parent class
			- `class Student(Person)` --> Child class
	- Accessing parent members in child class
		- Using Parent class name 
			- E.g. `Parent.name = name`
		- Using `super()`
			- E.g. `super(Child, self).__init__(name)`
- **Namespace**
	- Namespace is a space where names are defined and stored and helps avoid naming conflicts by ensuring that names are unique within a given scope
	- E.g. 
		- Built-in (Outermost)
			- Contains built-in functions and exceptions like `print()` and `int()`
		- Global
			- Contains names from all objects, functions and variables in the program at the top level
		- Local
			- Refers to names inside a function or method
- **PIP**
	- Python installer package: a command-line tool to install various Python modules
- **What is a zip function**
	- Returns a zip object --> iterator of tuples
	- Takes an iterable and converts it into an iterator, and aggregates the elements based on iterables passed
- **Pickling vs Unpickling**
	- Pickling: 
		- Converts any Python object into a byte stream
		- Byte stream can then be stored in a file, sent over a network, or saved for later use
		- `pickle.dump()`
	- Unpickling:
		- Process of retrieving the original Python object from the byte stream (saved during pickling)
		- `pickle.load()`
- **Instance, class, static method**
	- Instance method operates on an instance of the class and has access to instance attributes and takes `self` as the first parameter
	- Class method directly operates on the class itself and not on instance. Takes `cls` as the first parameter and defined with `@classmethod`
	- Static method does not operate on an instance or the class and takes no `self` or `cls` as an argument and is defined with `@staticmethod`
- **Python Global Interpreter Lock**
	- Process lock used by Python whenever it deals with processes
	- Generally, Python only uses one thread to execute the set of written statements
	- Performance of single-threaded process and multi-threaded process will be the same in Python because of the GIL
- **Python Switch-Case**
	- Since 3.10, Python implemented a switch-case called "structural pattern matching"
	- Implemented with `match` and `case` keywords
- **How to make Python Script executable on Unix**
	- Script file must begin with `#!/usr/bin/env python`
- **What is docstring in Python**
	- Documentation string or docstring is a multiline string used to document a specific code segment
- **Use of `self` in Python**
	- `self` is used to represent the instance of the class
	- With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class
	- `self` is not a keyword in Python
- **Access modifiers**
	- Protected attributes are defined with a underscore prefixed to their identifier 
		- E.g. `_sara`
		- Can still be accessed and modified from outside the class 
	- Private attributes are defined with double underscore to their identifier
		- E.g. `__ansh`
		- Cannot be accessed or modified from outside directly
- **Decorators in Python**
	- Functions that add functionality to an existing function in Python without changing the structure of the function itself
- **Garbage Collection**
	- Python has automatic garbage collection
	- Has `finalize` method for freeing up the unmanaged resources and clean up before garbage collection method is invoked
- **What is main function in Python**
	- Main function is considered the entry point of execution for a program
	-
