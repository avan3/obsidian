- **What is REST**
	- Representational State Transfer: most commonly used architectural style for building web services and APIs
	- Resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and operations are performed on those resources using standard HTTP methods
	- State of a resource is represented in JSON or XML which is transferred between the client and server in HTTP request and response bodies
- **Features of RESTful Web Services**
	- Based on the client-server model
	- Uses HTTP Protocol 
	- Medium of communication between client and server is called "Messaging"
	- Resources are accessible tot he server by means of URIs
	- Follows the statelessness concept
	- Can use caching to minimize server calls for the same type of repeated resources
- **What is HTTP**
	- Hypertext Transfer Protocol
	- Is the dominant protocol for transmitting data between clients and servers on the internet
	- Operates on a stateless request-response model, in which the client sends a request to the server and the server responds accordingly - without any knowledge of client's previous requests
- **What is SOAP**
	- An XML-based messaging protocol that is used to transfer data between distributed applications and systems
	- Follows a very strict structure
- **What is URI**
	- Uniform resource identifier
	- Full form of URI which is used for identifying each resource of the REST architecture
	- Format: `<protocol>://<service-name>/<ResourceType>/<ResourceID>`
- **What are HTTP headers? And which ones are most commonly used?**
	- Metadata that is included in an API request or response
	- Examples: 
		- Accept: defines the media types the client is able to accept from the server
		- Authorization: which is used to send client credentials to the server when client is attempting to access a protected resource
		- Content-type: defines the media type in the request body
		- Cache-control: defines how the response should be cached
		- Set-cookie: instructs the client to store a cookie with the specified attributes
- **What is a resource in a RESTful context**
	- A REST resource is any object or group of objects that can be accessed through a dedicated API endpoint
		- For example, a simple blog API may have an `author` resource that can be accessed via `/authors/:id` endpoint
- **Defining features of REST APIs**
	- Statelessness - every request from the client includes all necessary information, and the server doesn't store any client-specific data
		- Simplifies server design, and promotes horizontal scalability
	- Separation of concerns between the client and server
		- Client is responsible for the UI/UX
		- Server handles request processing resource management
		- Clear delineation ensures modularity and enables each component to evolve independently
	- Uniform interface
		- Endpoints are accessed with an established set of HTTP methods
		- Makes it easier to onboard new consumers
- **Core components of HTTP request**
	- Method/Verb - part tells what methods the request operation represents
	- URI - the part is used for uniquely identifying the resource on the server
	- HTTP Version - indicates which version of HTTP protocol is being used. E.g. HTTP v1.1
	- Request Header - details of the request metadata such as client type, content format supported, message format, cache settings, etc.
	- Request body - the actual message content to be sent to the server
- **Core components of HTTP response**
	- Response status code - server response status code for the requested resource
	- HTTP Version - indicates the HTTP protocol version
	- Response header - metadata of the response message
	- Response body - the actual resource/message returned from the server
- **List HTTP methods**
	- GET: used for fetching resource from the server, and is a read-only operation
	- POST: used for creation of new resources on the server
	- PUT: used to update the old/existing resource on the server or to replace the resource
	- DELETE: used to delete the resource on the server
	- PATCH: used for modifying the resource on the server
	- OPTIONS: fetches the list of supported options of resources present on the server
	- POST, GET, PUT, DELETE --> CRUD
- **PUT vs PATCH methods**
	- PUT and PATCH are both used to modify resources
	- PUT method works by replacing a resource with the data that is included in the request body
		- Any fields or properties not included in the request body are deleted
		- Any new fields or properties are added
	- PATCH is used for making partial updates to a resource
		- Can update one field or property even if the resource had many properties
		- More efficient than PUT because of a reduced amount of data that must be transferred
- **Idempotency**
	- An HTTP method is considered idempotent if it will result in the same outcome no matter how many times it is executed
	- All read-only methods (e.g. GET, OPTIONS, TRACE, HEAD) are idempotent, as are PUT and DELETE
		- PUT updates the resource and subsequent requests will be overwriting the same resource again without changing anything
		- DELETE is idempotent because the first request will return 200 and delete the resource. Subsequent requests result in nothing - Status Code 204 --> the response is different, but there is no change of resources on the server-side
			- However, deleting the *last* resource every request will change the resource and make DELETE not idempotent
	- POST and PATCH are not idempotent
		- POST because calling it multiple times will result in multiple resources being created
		- PATCH *can* be idempotent, but it is not necessarily so. 
			- E.g. May increment a specific field every time is it called, which would modify the resource every time
- **List HTTP Status codes**
	- 1xx - informational 
	- 2xx - successful
	- 3xx - redirections
	- 4xx - client errors
	- 5xx - server errors
- **Common HTTP status codes**
	- 200 OK - request was successful, and response includes the requested data
	- 201 CREATED - request was successful, and the server has created a new resource with the provided data
	- 204 NO CONTENT - request was successful, but there is no additional data to send in the response. 
		- Code is often used in response to DELETE requests
	- 400 BAD REQUEST - server cannot understand the request due to a client error, malformed syntax, or invalid parameters
	- 401 UNAUTHORIZED - client lacks valid credentials to access the requested data or perform the desired action
	- 403 FORBIDDEN - client does not have permission to access the requested resource, even with valid authentication credentials
	- 404 NOT FOUND - server cannot find the requested resource or endpoint
	- 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR - server encountered an unexpected issue
	- 503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE - server is not ready to handle the request, often due to overload or maintenance
	- 504 GATEWAY TIMEOUT - the server acting as a gateway or proxy did not receive a timely response from the upstream server
- **Advantages and disadvantages of statelessness in REST**
	- Advantages
		- Servers don't need to manage session data, which allows them to handle large number of concurrent requests and supports horizontal scaling
		- Leads to streamlined server logic and faster response times
	- Disadvantages:
		- Requests to REST API may have larger payloads, as the client must include all of the necessary information
			- Negatively impacts network performance
		- May also require clients to handle retries in the case of network or server failures, as there is no server-side context to help with these error scenarios
		- Not possible to maintain sessions
- **Some best practices for creating URI for web services**
	- When URI is updated, the older URI must be redirected to the new one using the HTTP status code 300
	- Use appropriate HTTP methods 
	- Use the technique of forward slashing to indicate the hierarchy between the resources and the collections. 
		- E.g. to get the address of the user of a particular id, we can use: `/users/{id}/address`
- **Some best practices for developing RESTful web services**
	- Respond with JSON data format whenever possible 
		- Ensure `Content-Type` is set to `application/JSON` for request and response headers
	- No more than 2-3 levels of nesting for the URI
		- E.g. `/authors/:id/address`
	- Error handling should be done by returning appropriate error codes the application has encountered 
		- Appropriate error messages should also be present
	- Incorporating SSL/TLS 
	- Use caching where appropriate
	- Include API versioning
