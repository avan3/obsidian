- **Tell me about yourself**
	-  I've been working in the tech field for roughly over 5 years. The majority of the time was spent as a full-stack developer. I'm mostly familiar with Angular and Spring Boot frameworks and by extension, TypeScript and Java programming languages. I spent a small portion of my professional career developing in React, and use it along with other technologies, such as NodeJS and MongoDB, in my personal projects as a way to learn more about the libraries or frameworks. 
	- My current title at TD is Software Developer I. I work on two different teams where we manage applications built in Angular and Spring Boot that call APIs built by other teams as a way to provide data to the application, or leverage a SQL Server Database. 
	- I believe when you work in the tech field, you have to learn and continuously grow. And I am interested in this position because I think that I would be able to translate my skills for this job while being good way for me to do learn and grow (add something to do with the job description)
	- On one team, one application is for credit card management. Another application is for viewing business cards and the details, and another is for viewing Visa card statements. The latter two being read-only applications
	- On the other team, they mainly manage APIs and have another app for pre-authorized debits
- **Why are you leaving your current role**
	- Like I mentioned before, I'm interested in learning and growing. I have been using Angular and Spring Boot in my work for a long time. I am interested in learning something new in a professional setting. 
	- Also, I am interested in applying my skills is a different context
- **What is your biggest weakness**
	- I believe my communication skills could be improved. I think this is one of the most important skills to have or else there could be miscommunications. 
	- I've faced this challenge at least a few times. Most recently, I started working with a coworker in my new team who I was previously familiar with and had conversations with. When we would talk about work, I noticed we would have miscommunications.
	- For example, we have been discussing an issue I am facing with work related to some code using a different config file than the one we need our application to use due to some conditions. I explained to her what the code was doing, and that we needed to delete the wrong config file so that the code would then find the correct one. She was under the impression we needed to delete the correct config file. We got on a call to chat about it and we cleared it up.
	- I took some time after the call to think about how I could've been more clear. I came up with two things:
		- 1. I should be more specific in how I say things. She assumed I was talking about the correct config file, when I was talking about the incorrect one.
		- 2. Experience. With more experience working with this coworker, I believe that we will understand each other more and less miscommunications will occur.

	- I used to work as a tutor while I was studying in Seneca. I found that with different students, they learn differently, so I would need to change how I taught them. Usually it involved simplifying the language or using a relatable example. 
- **What do you consider your greatest achievement**
	- The first time I received recognition from a coworker about my work.
	- In my previous job at Architech, it was when I started working as a full-stack developer. I was very unsure of myself at the time. I felt inexperienced and probably had some imposter syndrome. 
	- I worked when one specific coworker who worked as a Product Owner and was non-technical. I would often explain things to her, from my technical perspective, in a simple manner to the best of my ability. 
	- Later on, she recognized me on a company wide weekly appreciation post. I took a screenshot of the post and I still have it on my phone.
	- The reason I consider it my greatest achievement is because it made me realize that what I contribute to at work is making a difference, and gave me confidence in myself and motivation to continue working in this field. 
- **Tell me about a difficult situation you faced, and how you handled it**
	- About a year ago, we faced a production incident where some users were having trouble logging in to our application. This was after the decommissioning of Enterprise Directory (ED). 
	- A coworker had previously migrated these users to a new AD group and updated the code to no longer search users from ED. So it was not immediately obvious what the issue was since the users should have access with the AD group.
	- We found out later that these users were part of the RNET domain and not TDBFG when searching Active Directory (AD) 
	- So we thought instead to authorize the user, we could search the users by AD group, and allow access if the user could be found in that list. 
	- We suspected there may be a limit of 1500 to how many users can be searched in AD. However, we could not immediately confirm it because we did not have 1500 users in any AD group. 
	- There were suggestions of QE team generating the data, or bringing data from PROD to PAT environment and updating the sensitive information. However, due to timeline and effort constraints, we could not proceed with that.
	- After the first deployment in PROD, the issue was not resolved. At some point, we also had to revert the ED decommission changes.
	- In order to test the limit of the AD group search, I found an AD group that I suspected would have a lot of users. 
	- I was also able to arbitrarily set a number as the limit to mimic the behaviour of PROD with the suspected limit of 1500. 
	- From this, I was able to figure out how the AD group search changes based on the limit, and we were able to come up with a way to iterate as many times as necessary in order to search all the users in the AD group despite the 1500 search limit
- **Tell me about a time you failed/made a mistake**
	- Recently, we were working on a feature to update some text for a form generated on our application from a mockup provided by the business
	- There were some times when we would have wrong verbiage or questions we had to bring back to the business to answer.
	- There ended up being many iterations on the form leading to additional work and extended timelines
	- We learned from our mistake and created a Spike story to initially investigate the mockups and ensure we understood the scope or work, and also ask the business any questions we had before starting development.
	- As a result, the second time we had to update the forms, it went a lot more smoothly. And from my side, there were no more mistakes

- **Questions for hiring manager**
	- What is your team currently working on? Are there any big projects coming up?
	- How does your team operate on a day-to-day basis? E.g. my current team follows Agile
	- How can someone get up to speed quickly on this team?
	- What do you expect from a successful candidate in the 3 months of this role?
	- What are your expectations from someone who gets into this role?
	- Has there been any turnover recently in your team?
	- How do you support your team's career development?
	- Have you received any feedback from your team about your role as a manager?
	- If your job is reporting, are there periods when work becomes busier?
- **SOLID principles**
	- Single responsibility principle:
		- A class should only have one responsibility
	- Open-closed principle
		- Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
		- E.g. Animal class can't satisfy ALL animals, so need to extend from it and add functionality there instead of having Animal class adding functionality
	- Liskov Substitution Principle:
		- Every subclass should be substitutable for their base or parent class
		- If you have two classes that extended from a parent class, you should be able to substitute one for the other without the code breaking
		- E.g. If we had classes for different species of dogs, we should be able to substitute one class for another if we wanted to call a method in the class like a "bark" class
	- Interface Segregation Principle:
		- Client should never be forced to implement an interface it doesn't use, or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they don't use
		- E.g. shouldn't add functionality to a class that it won't use (e.g. if it needs to leave the method empty or just return instantly, then you probably should remove it)
	- Dependency Inversion Principle:
		- Class should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions
		- High level module must not depend on the low level module
		- Instead of creating concrete classes within another class which will tightly couple the two classes, we should use interfaces to allow us to use different implementations
		- E.g. Computer class with Keyboard and Mouse class. The Computer class shouldn't have a concrete class for Keyboard and Mouse because that would mean we would need to update the Computer class whenever the Keyboard or Mouse changes.
		- Instead we should create and pass the concrete classes for Keyboard and Mouse from outside the Computer class which can be used within the Computer class as we set interfaces inside the class
- **Key Phases of the SDLC**
	- **Planning:** Define project scope, goals, business cases, budget, and resources, laying the foundation for the project. 
	- **Requirements Analysis:** Gather and thoroughly document user and stakeholder needs to build the software. 
	- **Design:** Convert requirements into a detailed plan, outlining the system architecture, user interfaces, and database structure. 
	- **Development (Implementation):** Developers write the actual code based on the design blueprints. 
	- **Testing:** Rigorously test the code for bugs, integration issues, security vulnerabilities, and overall performance to ensure it functions as intended. 
	- **Deployment:** Release the software into the production environment for users. 
	- **Maintenance:** Provide ongoing support, updates, and monitoring to ensure the software continues to operate effectively and meet customer expectations.
- **XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language)** 
	- Is a standard (sounds like a de-facto standard) that involves tagging financial data so that it can be used in computer software and promotes communication between entities that will use the data (for purposes of reporting)
**Resume specific notes**
- At TD:
	- First bullet point (API Integration cost-saving initiative): 
		- The application CCMN uses branch information including cost center number, operating hours, location. 
		- Previous to me joining this team, they had a website where they would scrape the branch information from that website. However, that website would be decommissioned
		- The interim solution, that ended up being a long term solution, was that we would maintain a .txt file with of the branch information, and our code would parse this file
		- Usually multiple times in the calendar year, there would be a requirement to update the BranchInformation.txt file due to location changes or adding new branches. These updates would come to us from another team with an effective date where we would have to make the changes prior to this date.
		- This would require BSA/PO to create a story for the change, devs to make the change, QE to test, and involvement from the release team for the purpose of the deployment to higher environments.
		- The now permanent solution was for a separate team to create an API that would have all the branch information including any updates needed. Our application would make a request to this API daily to get all the branch information saved in an in-memory cache. 
		- After the solution was created, we no longer had to go through the repetitive process of the updates and deployments which, according to my PO, saved us $1M annually
	- Second bullet point (PDF prepopulation logic):
		- The application CCBCH leverages forms within PDFs to be filled out by the TD employee and the customer. For example, we have a form that is used for when the customer wants to transfer Aeroplan numbers to a new one.
		- We had a requirement to add new forms to the application and prepopulate the forms with certain customer information. 
		- Luckily, we already had some code in our codebase which dealt with prepopulation. For this requirement, we just had to expand on this. 
		- Each new form required going through the form and finding all the different fields and populating it with the correct customer/business information. 
		- There were a lot of edge cases, mainly involving incorrect numbering of the fields which ended up breaking our prepopulation logic. So I had to add specific conditions to handle this. Also, I documented all of these edge cases which was referenced quite a bit by my PO.
		- In the end, another PO sent out an email to quite a large amount of people notifying them of the changes, and recognizing our team for the work. 
	- Third bullet point (modernization of web application):
		- 
- At Jonah Group:
	- First bullet point (email notification):
		- System admin would need to know which passwords would expire, so in order to make sure system admin would know which passwords were expiring/expired, we developed a feature that would email the user daily when their password was expiring within a pre-defined time frame, or if it had already expired
	- Second bullet point (export dataset feature):
		- Application currently had an import feature that could import different file types. We created a feature that exported the data in a CSV format initially which was to be extended later on. 
- At Architech:
	-
