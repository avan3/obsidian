- **Static keyword**
	- Property or method belongs to the class itself
	- Does not need to be instantiated to use the property or method
	- Only one instance of that property or method, cannot have multiple instances
	- Cannot override a static method in Java
- **Class vs Object**
	- Class is a user-defined data type that can be used to create an object. It includes properties and methods. It is essentially a blueprint for creation of an object
	- An Object is an instance of the class 
- **Interface vs Abstract class**
	- Abstract classes is a class that can contain both abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods 
		- Can only extend from one abstract class
	- Interface has no concrete methods, only abstract methods 
		- Class implement from multiple interfaces
- **Pass by value vs Pass by reference**
	- Pass by value is only passing in the value itself and any modifications made to the value inside of the method is not changed for outside the method
	- Pass by reference is passing the reference for the variable itself, so changes made to the variable are updated for outside the method as well
	- JAVA IS PASS BY VALUE
- **Difference between == and .equals**
	- == compares the references 
	- equals() will check the contents of the object
- **Hashcode and equals**
	- equals() is used to compare two objects
	- hashCode() returns an integer that represents the current instance of the class
	- I believe you can use the hashcode generated to determine whether two objects are equal
- **What is Serializable**
	- Extending Serializable allows the object to be converted into a byte stream (serialization) which then can be converted back into an object (deserialization)
	- SerialVersionUID - a class version that is used to verify that the current version of the class is compatible during deserialization (can be backwards compatible)
- **Local, instance, and class variables**
	- Local variable: declared within a code block such as a method 
	- Instance variables: declared inside a class but outside of a method
	- Class variables: declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or code block
- **Synchronized keyword**
	- 
- **Autoboxing vs Unboxing**
	- 
- **Transient and Volatile**
	- 
- **Characteristics of OO programming languages**
	- Abstraction
		- Hiding away information, and only exposing what is necessary
		- E.g. a user doesn't need to know about how a car runs, they just need to be able to drive the car
	- Encapsulation
		- Grouping functions and data into a single entity
		- Accessing the data or methods is determined by access controls (i.e. private, protected, public keywords)
	- Inheritance 
		- Creating a new class from an existing class
		- Subclass is created from Superclass (parent-child relationship) where subclass inherits can inherit the properties and methods from the superclass depending on the appropriate access controls (i.e. protected and public, but not private)
	- Polymorphism
		- Multiple classes are able to use the same method name
		- Overloading vs Overriding:
			- Overloading is defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class
			- Overriding is when a subclass has it's own implementation and overrides the implementation by the superclass
- **Memory leaks in Java**
	- Memory leak is when an object or objects is no longer used but cannot be removed by the garbage collector. This can lead to performance degradation, running out of memory
	- E.g. not closing a connection to a database, or not closing an input stream
		- Reference to the objects will still exist preventing garbage collection
- **JUNIT**
- **JAVA WEB SERVICES**
- **MAVEN**
	- Build tool: tool to compile, test, and package your application (i.e. jar, war, ear)
	- Provides a default project structure, and pom.xml (**Project Object Model** config file which includes information about the project (including groupId, artifactId), versioning, dependencies, plugins)
- **GRADLE**
